# ABTesting

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dbof10/ABTesting.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dbof10/ABTesting)

Too much boilerplate and effort to implement a list using RecyclerView. But, most of them can be omitted. This library will take care of the heavy part and leave you the easy part.
